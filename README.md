# AI-Matrix-Plan-Generator
An application to formulate winning plans of a grid problem using AI search tree methods. Implemented in both; Java and Prolog.

## Description:

The prototype implemented is a form of program where the user inputs a grid String containing information about the matrix, including its size and the placements of the variables.

The grids represent a world space identical to that of “The Matrix” movie franchise, where “Neo” tries to save as many hostages as possible from the virus “Agent Smith” without dying.

The application then uses search tree methods to formulate a winning plan outputted in a series of movements.

#### The search tree methods implemented are:
1. Breadth-first search.
2. Depth-first search,
3. Iterative deepening search.
4. Uniform-cost search.
5. Greedy search with two heuristics.
6. A* search with two admissible heuristics.

Note: The prolog project was implemented for a simplified world where there is maximum two hostages to save, no pads, no pills, no agents, and the grid’s size is either 3×3 or 4×4.

#### More information:
You can find attaached to each of the project files a report detailing the steps on how the implementation was carried out as well as how to run the code.

## How to run:
1. Java:
  - Download the Porject1 file as zip to your computer.
  - Import to Eclipse as existing archive project and run.
2. Prolog:
  - Download the .pl file.
  - Open in Prolog and run.
